# DiseaseSim
2d physics simulation of disease spread

Blue dots represent uninfected individuals. Red dots are infected. Green dots were infected and recovered, and black dots represent deaths.
Number of individuals, movement speed, transmissibility, infection duration, and death rate are configurable.
